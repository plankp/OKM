# OKM

A programming language that has a builtin crappy optimizer!

Apart from that, it has modules which are like static classes.

Currently, it lacks a lot of usual stuff such as strings, arrays / pointers, classes / closures.

The sample code runner is also very slow. Tail calls are optimized however,
so it will not blow the stack if you write your returns properly.
